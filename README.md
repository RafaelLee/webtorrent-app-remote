# Webtorrent Remote Managment

This is my first public project.
Was created to personal use, but since @webtorrent is a public free and open source why my project based on it, shouldn't be?

If you liked the project, please, fork and share (and make it better).


Webtorrent Remote Managment is a very simple tool to manage WebTorrents in your server!
